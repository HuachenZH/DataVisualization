Hi, welcome.
This is a public directory for my code of Data Visualization Project of 4A of EIGSI.
A scolar project of data visualization using the R language, with the collaboration with my friend Oniel AHOUANVOEKE. I had his permission to upload all the source codes.

circular_barplot is the code for the circualr barplot. 

animation_circular_barplot is the code for the animation circular barplot. 
Thanks to r graph gallery who provides an example, and thanks to the package gganimate.

Choro 2 is the code for choropleth.

The three files above are an extract of the source code. You can find the source code in the folder source_code
