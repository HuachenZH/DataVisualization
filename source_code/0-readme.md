In this folder I upload my source R code, a folder of initial Rmarkdown file and a folder of HTML.

The Rmarkdown can do its work, however I find it not enough aesthethic, so I found a template of HTML which is free and legal to use, then replace the contents by my R results, directly in the HTML file.

After reviewing my workspace two months after the project, all I feel is what a mess. I need to arrange my workspace carefully next time.
